Overview
========

There is a cookbook for commands on the VSIM (simulates NetApp nodes). There is also another cookbook for setting up VSIMs in High Availability mode for AWS. View the ChefGuidelines.pdf for more information. 

The NetApp API files in ruby should be placed in /cookbooks/netapp/libraries.
